A research project done in R for a Regression Analysis class focused on analyzing the effect of three predictor variables on average length of stay for patients in different hospitals. Analysis was done using linear regression and comparing R^2 values.

Plotting done using R's integrated plotting and ggplot2.

Plotted graphs, box plots, outliers, histograms, QQ Plots;
Assessed normality using QQ Plots, Shapiro-Wilks, and Fligner-Killeen tests.
Conducted and found confidence and prediction intervals for predictor variables.

Further improvement to the analysis could have been done through the removal of outliers.
